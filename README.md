# Remember this Before Pushing Your Code - 
1. Make a separate branch of your name before pushing your code. <b>DO NOT PUSH ON MAIN BRANCH</b>
2. Make sure to make separate folder for each task. (Folder for task 1, task 2)
3. Some examples are shows for your reference. You need to add more similar elements like radio buttons, checkboxes, buttons, etc.
